        <h1>Muse Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Please note that our Privacy Policy was last updated on June 26th, 2024.
        </p>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Muse Publishing collects, uses, shares and processes
            your personal data. It details your privacy rights and how you can get in touch with us regarding your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Muse Publishing, Inc. (“Muse”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a company registered at 4151 Converse St, Fremont,
            VA, 94538, United States of America. For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and
            any relevant local legislation (“Data Protection Laws”) we are the Data Controller of your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we do this and the
            changes are material, we will post a notice that we have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website
            for at least 7 days before the changes are made, and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised
            at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective at the end
            of that 7 day period.
        </p>
        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <h3>Information you provide</h3>
        <p>
            When creating an account with Muse, we may collect personal parental information that you voluntarily
            provide to us. This may include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>Your year of birth</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This information may be used for communications and subscription payments. Your year of birth is used to
            verify your age as a parent.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you add a child profile to your account, you will provide us with a nickname or first name for the
            learner, and an approximate age. This information is not needed for any kind of account creation, nor does
            it need to be accurate. Nickname and approximate age are only used to generate learning content, and not to
            verify a user's identity. For example, you can provide any text for the learner's nickname, and the app will
            use that text when teaching how to write their name. We do not support any social or federated login.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Research and Development</h3>
        <p>
            If you opt-in to providing an email address during the registration process, we may contact you to
            participate in product research activities. These may include surveys, interviews, and other types of
            feedback sessions. When you participate in these research activities, the information you provide will be
            used to test, improve, and develop our products. We will record the video, audio and text transcriptions of
            this feedback together with any additional contact information you provide and will retain this data for two
            years.
            1. Request more information about the research activities you have volunteered for.
            2. Opt out of being contacted for research activities.
            3. Request a copy of any research related data you have provided to us.
        </p>
        <h3>Speech recognition</h3>
        <p>
            You can choose whether to enable speaking functionality for your child on Muse. Muse uses Apple’s speech
            recognition service to convert voice into text. No speech data ever is shared with Muse.
        </p>
        <h3>User generated content</h3>
        <p>
            We may collect user-generated content, such as stories, crafts, and games. This information is used
            exclusively within the app. Users are given the choice to flag their content to be published, which may be
            manually selected to be featured on the home page, alongside their username.
        </p>
        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            We only use third-party analytics on our website, not in our app. We use Google Analytics, which is a web
            analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with our website. Like many services, Google
            Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to
            collect information about how users use our site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us
            improve our site. These reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt
            out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s browser add-on available here.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How we use your information
        </h2>
        <h3>Providing services</h3>
        <p>

            <li>To improve and develop Muse, including testing, research, analysis and product development.</li>
            <li>To protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions and maintain the safety, security and
                integrity of Muse.</li>
            <li>To moderate content under our community standards and participation guidelines.</li>
            <li>To comply with our legal or contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
            <li>To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental
                regulations.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>
            Additionally, when you generate content, you are provided with the option to designate your content for potential publication. The Muse team exercises manual discretion in selecting content to be prominently displayed on the application's homepage for a duration of one week. Upon being featured on the homepage, the content, along with the associated username, will be publicly accessible to all individuals with a Muse account.
        </p>
        <p>
            We advise you to refrain from including any personal details in your submissions, such as information that can directly identify you, including but not limited to your name, age, and address. While we conduct a manual review of submissions to mitigate the inclusion of such information, we disclaim any liability for the privacy of any personally identifiable information that you elect to disclose within our application.
        </p>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>
            We may use your email address to send you important notifications, updates, and promotional materials related to Muse. You can opt-out of promotional emails at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Improving services</h3>
        <p>
            We analyze usage patterns to enhance our application's performance, content, and features, providing a better user experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Information sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We disclose you and your child’s personal data to the following categories of service providers and other parties: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Third party providers such as: Hosting and database providers like Fly.io and Supabase, and AI providers like OpenAI and RemoveBG
            </li>
            <li>Parties who acquire your Personal Data through an acquisition or other change of control. Personal Data may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
            We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will securely delete or anonymize your personal information once it is no longer needed for its intended purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Data security</h2>
        <p>
            Muse has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data and access credentials. However, given sufficient resources, a determined attacker could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the data we seek to protect.
        </p>
        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Muse is specifically designed for children aged 4 and above and is intended to be used under the supervision and guidance of adults or parents. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. Parents or guardians are encouraged to monitor and supervise their child's use of the app and contact us with any concerns about data collection or their child's privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13, you have the right to request that we allow you to review, modify or delete your child’s personal information, or that we stop further collection of the child’s personal information. If you wish to exercise those rights, please contact us at hello@joinmuse.ai. We will need to verify your identity before we can comply with your request.
        </p>
